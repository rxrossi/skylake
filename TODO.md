# Todo

- Add a select day, if something is selected, it filters entries (later we can add something to group by day or something)
  [year-month-day][timezone]
  timezone could be local or "America/Los Angeles"
  -- then we convert it to UTC so we can pass to FilterEntriesByUTCInput

- Add entry
  -- should not add similar entries (could be the same)
  -- if a task starts on one day and ends on another, it should split the AET/task time
